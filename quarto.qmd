## Some Important Literature

-   This reference describes a CNN used for image segmentation that I am working on modifying for my work [@unet].

-   This reference describes a method that speeds up NN training by ensuring that the the inputs to each layer come from a relatively similar distribution [@BN].

-   This reference is a paper from META that describes their attempt at a foundation model for image segmentation [@SAM].

## A Cool Equation or Two

-   Euler's identity

$$
e^{i \pi} - 1 = 0
$$

-   Basic NN function

$$
\vec{z} = \sigma(\vec{y}) =  \sigma (W\vec{x} + \vec{b})
$$
